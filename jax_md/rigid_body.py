"""Code to simulate rigid bodies in two- and three-dimensions.

This code contains a number of pieces that handle different parts of
rigid body simulations.

To start with, we include some quaternion utilities for representing oriented
bodies in three dimensions.

Rigid body simulations are split into two components.

1) The state of rigid bodies are represented by a dataclass containing a
center-of-mass position and an orientation. Along with this type
representation, the core simulation functions are overloaded to automatically
allow deterministic NVE and NVT simulations to work with state composed of
RigidBody objects (see `simulation.py` for details). If you need any other
simulation environments, please raise a github issue.

One subtlety of the type system that we use here is that a host of related
quantities are represented by RigidBody objects. For example, the momentum
is represented by a RigidBody containing the linear momentum and angular
momentum, while the mass is a RigidBody containing the total mass and the
moment of inertia. This allows us to naturally use JAX's tree_map utilities
to jointly map over the different related quantities. Additionally, forces
inherit the RigidBody type with a center-of-mass force and torque.

2) Interactions between rigid bodies are specified. This is largely responsible
for dictating the shape of the rigid body. While arbitrary interactions are
possible, we include utility functions for producing rigid bodies that are
made by the union of point-like particles. This captures many common models
of rigid molecules and colloids. These functions work by providing a
RigidPointUnion object that specifies the location of point particles in the
body frame along with a pointwise energy function. This approach works with or
without neighbor lists and yields a function that computes the total energy on
a system of rigid bodies.

The quaternion utilities are divided into private helper functions and public

help enforce type safety. The private version of the functions take raw arrays,

of additional dimensions.

  information about the orientation of the body. In practice, this means that
  `RigidBody` objects are used to describe a number quantities that all have a
  center-of-mass and orientational components.

  For example, the instantaneous state of a rigid body might be described by a
  `RigidBody` containing center-of-mass position and orientation. The momentum
  of the body will be described by a `RigidBody` containing the linear momentum

"""Rigid bodies as unions of point-like particles.

All of the preceding code is valid for any rigid body. Now, we provide a set
of tools for easily constructing energy functions for one class of rigid
bodies. In particular, we provide utilities for defining rigid bodies as
rigid unions of point-like particles. These point-like particles can have
arbitrary interactions between them (which we refer to as the point-species).
Additionally, different rigid point unions can be put into the same simulation.

The rigid point union is synonymous with the shape of the body. Of course this
represents a small subset of the total possible set of rigid body potentials
and it would be interesting to explore other possibilities.
"""


@dataclasses.dataclass
class RigidPointUnion:
  """.. _rigid_body_union:

  Defines a rigid collection of point-like masses glued together.

  This class describes a rigid body as a collection of point-like particles
  rigidly arranged in space. These points can have variable masses. Rigid
  bodies interact by specifying well-defined pair potentials between the
  different points. This is a common model for rigid molecules and colloids.

  To avoid a singularity in the case of a rigid body with a single point, the
  particles are represented by disks in two-dimensions and spheres in
  three-dimensions so that each point-mass has a moment of inertia,
  :math:`I_{disk} = r^2/2` in two-dimensions and :math:`I_{sphere} = 2r^2/5`
  in three-dimensions.

  Each point can optionally be described by an integer specifying its species
  (that we will refer to as a "point species"). Different point species
  typically interact with different potential parameters.

  Additionally, this class can store multiple different shapes packed together
  that get referenced by a "shape species". In this case `total_points` refers
  to the total number of points among all the shapes while `shape_count` refers
  to the number of different kinds of shapes.

  Attributes:
    points: An array of shape `(total_points, spatial_dim)` specifying the
      position of the points making up each rigid shape.
    masses: An array of shape `(total_points,)` specifying the mass of each
      point in the union.
    point_count: An array of shape `(shape_count,)` specifying the number of
      points in each shape.
    point_offset: An array of shape `(shape_count,)` specifying the starting
      index in the `points` array for each shape.
    point_species: An optional array of shape `(total_points,)` specifying
      the species of each point making up the rigid shape.
    point_radius: A float specifying the radius for the disk / sphere used
      in computing the moment of inertia for each point-like particle.
